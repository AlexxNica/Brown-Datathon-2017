# Brown-Datathon-2017
Introduction to D3.js workshop for the 2017 Brown Datathon.

## What is D3.js?

"D3 (Data-Driven Documents or D3.js) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML.  D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction."

## Setting Up D3

There are two ways you can setup D3.js for your visualization.  Please note that version four of D3.js was released this past summer.  My introduction uses version three.  Keep this in mind if you decide to use my example as source code.

* Download D3.js and support it locally

1.
	npm install d3 
or https://unpkg.com/d3@4.7.1/build/



* Serve your project locally and use CDN

	<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>

## Documentation

D3.js is extremely well documented.  This should be the first place you turn if you need help: [https://d3js.org/](https://d3js.org/)
